DMX512 for PIC16F1574

1. See video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dGFsjU8-uQ  (0:02~1:54)
Sorry for Chinese speech, this video used for self introduction to professor.

2. 0:27~0:43 is MPLAB X IDE, 'xc.h' is in the IDE. I don't use makefile, because I compile on this IDE.
MPLAB X is free, but the compiler 'xc8' isn't free. You would find xc8 crack software to install it.

3. The code extended from PIC demonstration code (DMX512 only), code is at bottom.

4. The code used for PIC16F1575, the space is twice to pic16f1574.
